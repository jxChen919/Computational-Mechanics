# Computational-Mechanics
Here are the original code of Computational Mechanics course project.
The "code" folder contains the code for all questions involved in the course project.
An example of a plane problem based on elastic mechanics is given in the "example" folder. 
If you can understand the general architecture of the code, then it should be able to solve many corresponding problems in complex situations.
Thanks for visiting
